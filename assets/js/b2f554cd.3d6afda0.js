not have access to the Cloudspace the collection belong to.\\n\\n 2. **Infinite loops**: This security issue can lead to using Koxy AI to build infinite DDoS attacks and loops from multiple locations in the network by sending requests to the same deployment URL but using another endpoint to send the requests. the issue has been fixed and It\'s blocked now.\\n\\n ![Loops

Using Koxy AI the bad way ?\\n\\nA lot of people around the social media have been talking about how Koxy AI can be misused or used to do bad things, and how the idea is being misunderstaned by a lot of people, the fact that Koxy AI is a powerful system is true, and We are currently doing our best to restrict all the ways that can be used to do bad things throught Koxy AI edge-cloud.\\n\\nWe are taking all the concerns in a very serious way and doing our best to make the technology safer everyday.\\n\\nKoxy AI\'s core is the KSS (Koxy Simulation System) that does all the magic. You just build a simple JSON object and It turns it into an API, so basically You give it the API logic and It builds the actual code and run it in the cloud, served from 35 regions around the world at the edge. and at the edge means from the closest region to your users.\\n\\nAnd yes, Koxy AI can serve your API at the speed of 2ms to 10ms if you are not doing any heavy job. and It can iterate on a very high speed and It\'s great to do DDoS attacks and We are currently working our best to build a safty system to block any pattern similar to any of these attacks, believe me no one wants that to be available to anyone for only $12.\\n\\nLook at the numbers below:\\n\\n![Number of requests to Koxy AI](requests.png)\\n\\nWe\'ve served this huge number of requests in a week and our system is ready to serve millions more without any issues.\\n\\n## How is Koxy AI designed ?\\n\\nWell, if you\'re talking about the platform It\'s a really simple React website, the big thing is the API builder, All your API endpoints and nodes are just JSON objects that can be parsed by the simulation system.\\n\\nIf You\'re talking about the edge-cloud, It\'s where the simulation system hosted, It\'s built on top of [Deno](https://deno.com) and uses [GUN DB](https://gun.eco) for real-time decentralized communications.\\n\\nAnd about the simulation system, We are going to publish a full document about how It\'s built and how It works soon.\\n\\n## Koxy AI team\\n\\nWell, I want to thank every single one in our small creative team:\\n\\n - Traviss Scat (Development)\\n\\n - Yue Trye (Development)\\n\\n - Tati Charch (AI Development)\\n\\n - Josh Clark (laws)\\n\\n - Taylor Gable (laws)\\n\\n - and me, Kais Radwan (Almost everything)"},{"id":"zero-launch-day-23","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/zero-launch-day-23","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-17-zero-launch-day-23/index.md","title":"ZERO-LAUNCH: Day 23","description":"It\'s the 23th day of our launch event, ZERO-LAUNCH.","date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 17, 2023","tags":[{"label":"koxy","permalink":"/blog/tags/koxy"},{"label":"zero-launch","permalink":"/blog/tags/zero-launch"},{"label":"launch","permalink":"/blog/tags/launch"}],"readingTime":1.075,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Koxy Team","title":"Koxy AI blogging team","url":"https://koxy-ai.web.app/about-us","imageURL":"https://fqoeejiwzrmeiaxejxjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public/logos/koxy_new_modern_small%20(1).ico","key":"koxy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"zero-launch-day-23","title":"ZERO-LAUNCH: Day 23","authors":["koxy"],"tags":["koxy","zero-launch","launch"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What is Koxy AI for real ?","permalink":"/blog/what-is-koxy-ai-for-real"},"nextItem":{"title":"Build your backend with Koxy AI: part 2","permalink":"/blog/build-your-backend-with-koxy-ai-2"}},"content":"It\'s the 23th day of our launch event, [ZERO-LAUNCH](https://koxy-ai.web.app/zero-launch).\\n\\n![Koxy AI zero launch: day 23](day23.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIt\'s been an interesting month so far, and We want to thank everyone of you for supporting and standing with us.\\n\\nWe just wanted to share some good news with you, as you\'re part of this journey \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n - Koxy AI ZERO-LAUNCH event is now ranked as the top 1st event on Crunchbase.

Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+Neon+Music+Network) using Koxy AI...\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What is Koxy AI ?\\n\\nWell, Koxy AI is a no-code platform that gives you the ability to build your serverless backend without writing a single line of code.\\n\\nIf you want to know more about how Koxy AI works, I recommend you check the [getting started documentation](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started).\\n\\n## Koxy AI is more than a no-code platform\\n\\nKoxy AI offers advanced features to give you the ability to build your backend based on the modern development standards.\\n\\n### Dynamic variables\\n\\nLet\'s first talk about [dynamic variables](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started/dynamic-variables)... in my opinion this is the most important feature in Koxy AI for anyone building complex and dynamic apps.\\n\\nYou can use dynamic variables to do things like getting a value of an environment variable, previous node\'s response, parameter, header, and even build relational data documents using [Koxy Database](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/koxy-database).\\n\\n### Simulation\\n\\nThe way that Koxy AI system works is unique, We actually simulate your backend instead of hosting it on a physical server, you can learn more about this [here](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/how-koxy-ai-works).\\n\\n### Koxy Database\\n\\nKoxy Database is so similar to [Firebase\'s Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), data is saved in collections as JSON documents.\\n\\nI\'ve added a cool feature to the Koxy Database actually, and it\'s the feature that prevent us from calling it a NoSQL database. Koxy Database supports [document embedding](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/koxy-database/document-embedding) or what\'s called relational data. I built this feature few days ago actually and I\'m excited to see how developer interact and work with it.\\n\\n### Nodes\\n\\nNodes are self-contained functions... they can be connected together to build up an API endpoint, what connects nodes together are [triggers](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started/nodes/understanding-nodes#triggers). there are a number of different triggers in every node. I recommend you check our [available nodes list](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/available-nodes).\\n\\n## There is a lot to talk about\\n\\nKoxy AI has a huge range of features and I can\'t cover all of them. I just wanted to talk about some features in the first part of this series and I\'ll try my best to share a post every day.\\n\\nThank you for reading."},{"id":"koxy-ai-roadmap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/koxy-ai-roadmap","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-7-Koxy-ai-roadmap/index.md","title":"Koxy AI Roadmap","description":"Koxy AI roadmap is a really interesting journey from a chatbot to a no-code serverless platform.","date":"2023-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"roadmap","permalink":"/blog/tags/roadmap"},{"label":"about","permalink":"/blog/tags/about"},{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":0.37,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Koxy Team","title":"Koxy AI blogging team","url":"https://koxy-ai.web.app/about-us","imageURL":"https://fqoeejiwzrmeiaxejxjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public/logos/koxy_new_modern_small%20(1).ico","key":"koxy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"koxy-ai-roadmap","title":"Koxy AI Roadmap","authors":["koxy"],"tags":["roadmap","about","welcome"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Build your backend with Koxy AI: part 1","permalink":"/blog/build-your-backend-with-koxy-ai"},"nextItem":{"title":"ZERO-LAUNCH Event","permalink":"/blog/zero-launch"}},"content":"Koxy AI roadmap is a really interesting journey from a chatbot to a no-code serverless platform.\\n\\n![Koxy AI roadmap](koxy_roadmap.png)\\n\\nKoxy AI has a pretty interesting roadmap, from starting as a simple AI chatbot, to being a no-code platform to build serverless AI-powered backend distributed globally from 35 regions around the world.\\n\\nWe are really happy that We got to this level and looking to deliver more in the future.\\n\\nfollow the project status [here](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/status)"},{"id":"zero-launch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/zero-launch","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-7-ZERO-LAUNCH/index.md","title":"ZERO-LAUNCH Event","description":"We are launching Koxy AI with zero-budget marketing...!","date":"2023-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"event","permalink":"/blog/tags/event"},{"label":"zero-launch","permalink":"/blog/tags/zero-launch"},{"label":"launch","permalink":"/blog/tags/launch"},{"label":"offers","permalink":"/blog/tags/offers"}],"readingTime":0.495,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Koxy Team","title":"Koxy AI blogging team","url":"https://koxy-ai.web.app/about-us","imageURL":"https://fqoeejiwzrmeiaxejxjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public/logos/koxy_new_modern_small%20(1).ico","key":"koxy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"zero-launch","title":"ZERO-LAUNCH Event","authors":["koxy"],"tags":["event","zero-launch","launch","offers"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Koxy AI Roadmap","permalink":"/blog/koxy-ai-roadmap"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"We are launching Koxy AI with zero-budget marketing...!\\n\\n![Image](launch_event_1.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n### Why ZERO-LAUNCH ?\\n\\nThere are thousands of small developers publishing great products everyday and just nobody knows about it because they don\'t have the require budget to advertise their products to the market.
