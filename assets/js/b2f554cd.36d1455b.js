We released the experiment version of Koxy AI just a week ago and We got a lot of support from the community, a lot of developers already started building cool projects using Koxy AI, a lot are still testing it, a lot didn\'t get a chance to try the free version... thank you all, You are all helping us make Koxy AI better.\\n\\n### What\'s next\\n\\nWe still have a lot of things to work on, for example the documentation now is out of date, We need to add languages to the platform, some users still experiencing latency in the edge-cloud, and a lot of new nodes are under development... We will continue working on making Koxy AI better for you everyday .!!"},{"id":"update-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/update-1","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-11-UPDATE1/index.md","title":"UPDATE: Logs, analytics, UI updates, and more","description":"UPDATE 11 August 2023: Releasing new features such as live logging, analytics, some upgrades to the UI interface, and more...","date":"2023-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2023","tags":[{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"},{"label":"getting started","permalink":"/blog/tags/getting-started"}],"readingTime":0.84,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Koxy Team","title":"Koxy AI blogging team","url":"https://koxy-ai.web.app/about-us","imageURL":"https://fqoeejiwzrmeiaxejxjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public/logos/koxy_new_modern_small%20(1).ico","key":"koxy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"update-1","title":"UPDATE: Logs, analytics, UI updates, and more","authors":["koxy"],"tags":["welcome","getting started"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The stable version is here","permalink":"/blog/stable-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Drag-and-drop API Builder","permalink":"/blog/api-builder"}},"content":"UPDATE 11 August 2023: Releasing new features such as live logging, analytics, some upgrades to the UI interface, and more...\\n\\n![Koxy AI Update 11 august 2023](UPDATE-11-8-2023.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Logs\\n\\nNow you can keep tracking of your logs live from the **logs** tab in your Cloudspace.

Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+Neon+Music+Network) using Koxy AI...\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What is Koxy AI ?\\n\\nWell, Koxy AI is a no-code platform that gives you the ability to build your serverless backend without writing a single line of code.\\n\\nIf you want to know more about how Koxy AI works, I recommend you check the [getting started documentation](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started).\\n\\n## Koxy AI is more than a no-code platform\\n\\nKoxy AI offers advanced features to give you the ability to build your backend based on the modern development standards.\\n\\n### Dynamic variables\\n\\nLet\'s first talk about [dynamic variables](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started/dynamic-variables)... in my opinion this is the most important feature in Koxy AI for anyone building complex and dynamic apps.\\n\\nYou can use dynamic variables to do things like getting a value of an environment variable, previous node\'s response, parameter, header, and even build relational data documents using [Koxy Database](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/koxy-database).\\n\\n### Simulation\\n\\nThe way that Koxy AI system works is unique, We actually simulate your backend instead of hosting it on a physical server, you can learn more about this [here](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/how-koxy-ai-works).\\n\\n### Koxy Database\\n\\nKoxy Database is so similar to [Firebase\'s Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), data is saved in collections as JSON documents.\\n\\nI\'ve added a cool feature to the Koxy Database actually, and it\'s the feature that prevent us from calling it a NoSQL database. Koxy Database supports [document embedding](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/koxy-database/document-embedding) or what\'s called relational data. I built this feature few days ago actually and I\'m excited to see how developer interact and work with it.\\n\\n### Nodes\\n\\nNodes are self-contained functions... they can be connected together to build up an API endpoint, what connects nodes together are [triggers](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started/nodes/understanding-nodes#triggers). there are a number of different triggers in every node. I recommend you check our [available nodes list](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/available-nodes).\\n\\n## There is a lot to talk about\\n\\nKoxy AI has a huge range of features and I can\'t cover all of them. I just wanted to talk about some features in the first part of this series and I\'ll try my best to share a post every day.\\n\\nThank you for reading."},{"id":"koxy-ai-roadmap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/koxy-ai-roadmap","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-7-Koxy-ai-roadmap/index.md","title":"Koxy AI Roadmap","description":"Koxy AI roadmap is a really interesting journey from a chatbot to a no-code serverless platform.","date":"2023-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"roadmap","permalink":"/blog/tags/roadmap"},{"label":"about","permalink":"/blog/tags/about"},{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":0.37,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Koxy Team","title":"Koxy AI blogging team","url":"https://koxy-ai.web.app/about-us","imageURL":"https://fqoeejiwzrmeiaxejxjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public/logos/koxy_new_modern_small%20(1).ico","key":"koxy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"koxy-ai-roadmap","title":"Koxy AI Roadmap","authors":["koxy"],"tags":["roadmap","about","welcome"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Build your backend with Koxy AI: part 1","permalink":"/blog/build-your-backend-with-koxy-ai"},"nextItem":{"title":"ZERO-LAUNCH Event","permalink":"/blog/zero-launch"}},"content":"Koxy AI roadmap is a really interesting journey from a chatbot to a no-code serverless platform.\\n\\n![Koxy AI roadmap](koxy_roadmap.png)\\n\\nKoxy AI has a pretty interesting roadmap, from starting as a simple AI chatbot, to being a no-code platform to build serverless AI-powered backend distributed globally from 35 regions around the world.\\n\\nWe are really happy that We got to this level and looking to deliver more in the future.\\n\\nfollow the project status [here](https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/status)"},{"id":"zero-launch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/zero-launch","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-7-ZERO-LAUNCH/index.md","title":"ZERO-LAUNCH Event","description":"We are launching Koxy AI with zero-budget marketing...!","date":"2023-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"event","permalink":"/blog/tags/event"},{"label":"zero-launch","permalink":"/blog/tags/zero-launch"},{"label":"launch","permalink":"/blog/tags/launch"},{"label":"offers","permalink":"/blog/tags/offers"}],"readingTime":0.495,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Koxy Team","title":"Koxy AI blogging team","url":"https://koxy-ai.web.app/about-us","imageURL":"https://fqoeejiwzrmeiaxejxjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public/logos/koxy_new_modern_small%20(1).ico","key":"koxy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"zero-launch","title":"ZERO-LAUNCH Event","authors":["koxy"],"tags":["event","zero-launch","launch","offers"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Koxy AI Roadmap","permalink":"/blog/koxy-ai-roadmap"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"We are launching Koxy AI with zero-budget marketing...!\\n\\n![Image](launch_event_1.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n### Why ZERO-LAUNCH ?\\n\\nThere are thousands of small developers publishing great products everyday and just nobody knows about it because they don\'t have the require budget to advertise their products to the market.
