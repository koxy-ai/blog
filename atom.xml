        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody, so We are just launching Koxy AI and I wanted to talk about some of the cachy features that Koxy AI offers. this will be a series of posts that I'll share here and We will end up building a new version of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+Neon+Music+Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neon Music Network</a> using Koxy AI...</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-koxy-ai-">What is Koxy AI ?<a href="#what-is-koxy-ai-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Koxy AI ?" title="Direct link to What is Koxy AI ?">​</a></h2><p>Well, Koxy AI is a no-code platform that gives you the ability to build your serverless backend without writing a single line of code.</p><p>If you want to know more about how Koxy AI works, I recommend you check the <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting started documentation</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="koxy-ai-is-more-than-a-no-code-platform">Koxy AI is more than a no-code platform<a href="#koxy-ai-is-more-than-a-no-code-platform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Koxy AI is more than a no-code platform" title="Direct link to Koxy AI is more than a no-code platform">​</a></h2><p>Koxy AI offers advanced features to give you the ability to build your backend based on the modern development standards.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dynamic-variables">Dynamic variables<a href="#dynamic-variables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dynamic variables" title="Direct link to Dynamic variables">​</a></h3><p>Let's first talk about <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started/dynamic-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamic variables</a>... in my opinion this is the most important feature in Koxy AI for anyone building complex and dynamic apps.</p><p>You can use dynamic variables to do things like getting a value of an environment variable, previous node's response, parameter, header, and even build relational data documents using <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/koxy-database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koxy Database</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simulation">Simulation<a href="#simulation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simulation" title="Direct link to Simulation">​</a></h3><p>The way that Koxy AI system works is unique, We actually simulate your backend instead of hosting it on a physical server, you can learn more about this <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/how-koxy-ai-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="koxy-database">Koxy Database<a href="#koxy-database" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Koxy Database" title="Direct link to Koxy Database">​</a></h3><p>Koxy Database is so similar to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase's Firestore</a>, data is saved in collections as JSON documents.</p><p>I've added a cool feature to the Koxy Database actually, and it's the feature that prevent us from calling it a NoSQL database. Koxy Database supports <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/koxy-database/document-embedding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document embedding</a> or what's called relational data. I built this feature few days ago actually and I'm excited to see how developer interact and work with it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nodes">Nodes<a href="#nodes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Nodes" title="Direct link to Nodes">​</a></h3><p>Nodes are self-contained functions... they can be connected together to build up an API endpoint, what connects nodes together are <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/getting-started/nodes/understanding-nodes#triggers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triggers</a>. there are a number of different triggers in every node. I recommend you check our <a href="https://koxy-ai.github.io/koxy-docs/available-nodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available nodes list</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-is-a-lot-to-talk-about">There is a lot to talk about<a href="#there-is-a-lot-to-talk-about" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to There is a lot to talk about" title="Direct link to There is a lot to talk about">​</a></h2><p>Koxy AI has a huge range of features and I can't cover all of them. I just wanted to talk about some features in the first part of this series and I'll try my best to share a post every day.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>]]></content>
